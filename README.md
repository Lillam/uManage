### Reason for development
For the longest time I've been desiring a project to work on, and had been fascinated with task management applications 
as a whole. Whilst also loving documenting my days on the daily. This was the beginning of the project, as a space to
simply be able to view and visualise all that goes on in my day to day. Beginning the base for having statistics to
graph out my days, my moods, words chosen etc. And is a project that opens up many ways to utilise the day that gets 
inserted from my daily life.
